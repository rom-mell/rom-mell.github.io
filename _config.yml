  I have over 12 years of experience in analysing and managing all sorts of data from Service Management incident and change tickets, employee databases, bank infrastructure incident
  alerts, agricultural price forecasting and more. I leverage my programming skills to automate downloading or extraction of data from several sources, scrubbing it and warehousing it for consistently
  accurate source for reports and analysis as I believe data insights are only as accurate as the quality of the source data.
